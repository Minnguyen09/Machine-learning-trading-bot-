The SVC model had a precision value of 56% for positive stock returns, and a precison of 43% for negative stock returns.

Positive stock returns have a recall of 96%, whilst negative returns have a recall value of 4% as per the SVC model.

## Plot for Logistic Regression model

The Logistic Regression model had a precison of 56% for positive stock returns, whilst for negative stock returns the precision was 44%.

The positive stock returns had recall of 66%, and negative stock returns has recall of 33%.

Answer

It should be noted that SVC Model has an accuracy of 55%. And Logistic Regression model has an accuracy of 52%.

Therefore, the baseline model (SVC model) has performed better than the new model (Logistic Regression model) with tuned trading algorithm.
